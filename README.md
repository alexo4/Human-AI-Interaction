## Chatbot

I have created a chatbot with the main functionality of creating a watch list of movies so that users can keep track of
different movies they would like to watch. A user could then use the chatbot when they are wondering what movie they
want to watch. It does this by recommending movies based on a movie the user already likes, allowing the user to find new
recommendations. They can then query these movies to find more information about them, allowing them to determine
whether it is a movie they would like. It also has question and answering, small talk and change name capabilities so that
it is more conversational and personalized to the user.
